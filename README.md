# Excursion - Codecademy Project

A [Codecademy project](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path/tracks/fscp-bringing-your-site-online/modules/off-platform-excursion-project/projects/f1-excursion) in which we are asked to build a single-page website using HTML and CSS, and then using Git and GitHub, host the website online.

## Codecademy Project Description

*"In this project, you’ll create a web page which advertises a product called “Excursion.” You’ll use your growing toolset including HTML, CSS, Command Line Interface, Git, and GitHub. You’ll be proud of yourself when it all comes together!*

*The web page we’ll build advertises a mobile app which helps users record and share their experiences, so we’ll use video and landscape imagery to set the scene. A landing page is a vital tool in marketing a product these days, and the goal will be to entice potential customers into using the product.*

*We’ll work with Git and GitHub on our local machines, so if you haven’t yet, refer to the articles on Command Line Interface Setup and Git Setup.*

*A preview of the page is available [here](https://content.codecademy.com/programs/freelance-one/excursion/index.html)!"*
